# GAS Framework
An enhanced web framework (based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)) for use in the capstone project. Adds robust user authentication (via [Globus Auth](https://docs.globus.org/api/auth)), modular templates, and some simple styling based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

Directory contents are as follows:
`/home/ubuntu/gas`


* `/web` - The GAS web app files [all web server code and templates]
* `/ann` - Annotator files [all annotator code, including AnnTools]
* `/util` - Utility scripts/apps for notifications, archival, and restoration [notifications, archival, restoration utilities]
* `/aws` - AWS user data files [user data scripts for provisioning instances]
